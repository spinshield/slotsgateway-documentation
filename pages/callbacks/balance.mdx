# Callback Action: balance

The `balance` callback is sent to your **callback URL** as configured on **Settings** section in the backoffice.

This callback is triggered **at the start of a game session** and is used to retrieve the player’s current balance.

You must always return the player balance as an **integer value in cents**.

The `call_id` is a **unique identifier** sent with every callback and can be treated as a transaction reference.

⚠️ **Important**

- Your callback endpoint must always respond with **HTTP status code `200`**
- This applies to **all responses**, including errors
- Error handling is done **only via the JSON body**, not HTTP status codes

---

## Requests

All callbacks are sent as **`GET` requests** to the callback URL configured on your API key.
