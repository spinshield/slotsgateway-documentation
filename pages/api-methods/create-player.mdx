# createPlayer Method

The `createPlayer` method is used to create a new player within the Slotsgateway system.  
This method should be called **before any other API requests**.

For a safe and consistent integration, you should **always call this method**, even if the player may already exist in your system.

If the player already exists, the request is automatically redirected to the  
[`playerExists` method](/api-methods/player-exists).
