# getGame Method

The `getGame` method opens a **real-money game session** and returns a game launch URL that should be served directly to the player.

Before calling this method, you should **always invoke the  
[`createPlayer` method](/api-methods/create-player)** to ensure the player exists in the Slotsgateway system.

When specifying the game, you must always use the `id_hash` value returned by the  
[`getGameList` method](/api-methods/gamelist).

To open a **demo (fun-play) session**, use the  
[`getGameDemo` method](/api-methods/get-game-demo) instead.
