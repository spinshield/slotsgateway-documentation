# getGameDemo Method

The `getGameDemo` method opens a **demo (fun-play) game session** and returns a game URL that should be served directly to the player.

This session does **not** use real money and does not require a player account to be created beforehand.

When specifying the game, you must always use the `id_hash` value returned by the  
[`getGameList` method](/api-methods/gamelist).
