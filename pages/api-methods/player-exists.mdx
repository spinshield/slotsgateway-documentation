# playerExists Method

The `playerExists` method is **deprecated** and should **not be called directly**.

Instead, you should always use the [createPlayer method](/api-methods/create-player).  
If the player already exists, the request is automatically redirected internally to `playerExists`.

This ensures a safe and consistent player initialization flow.
