# getFreeRounds Method

The `getFreeRounds` method returns the **complete free spins history** for a specific player, including both active and completed free spins sessions.

### Free Spins Fields Explained

- `freespins_bet`  
  Initially set to `0` and updated **after the first free spin is played** to reflect the actual bet amount.

- `freespins_wallet`  
  Represents the **total winnings** accumulated from the free spins session.

- `freespins_performed`  
  Indicates how many free spins have already been played.

- `freespins`  
  The total number of free spins granted.

A free spins bonus can be considered **completed** when:
- `freespins_performed` equals `freespins`
- `active` is set to `false`
