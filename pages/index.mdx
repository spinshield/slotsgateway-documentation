Confirm your email address from the backoffice after registration.

### Configure Callback URL
In the **Settings** section, set your callback URL. This endpoint will receive all game and balance callbacks.

### Generate API Credentials

</Steps>

## PHP Client

If your project uses PHP, we provide a Composer package to speed up integration.

- GitHub package: [spinshield/spinclient](https://github.com/spinshield/spinclient)  
- Install via Composer: `composer require spinshield/spinclient`

## API Requests

All requests to the game server should be sent as `POST` requests with a JSON body.

Your request body must always include `api_login` and `api_password`.  
You can find these credentials in the [backoffice](/2-backoffice).

```json
{
  "api_login": "d13b1ceb-6209-4163-b1cf-f304c28b81ec",
  "api_password": "dqRin2nfLosij2n88"
}
```

## Callback Communication

Our game server sends `GET` requests to your callback URL and expects a JSON response containing:

- `error` (error code)
- `balance` (player balance)

If you cannot retrieve the player balance for any reason, return `0`.

**Balance must be an integer in cents.**  
Example: a balance of `2.50$` must be returned as `250`.

### Successful Response
```json
{
  "error": 0,
  "balance": 250
}
```

### Insufficient Balance Response
```json
{
  "error": 1,
  "balance": 250
}
```

### Processing Error
```json
{
  "error": 2,
  "balance": 0
}
```
