# addFreeRounds Method

The `addFreeRounds` method assigns free spins to a player for a specific slot game.  
If the player is already playing the slot, the free spins will start on the **next available spin or game initialization**.

Free spins are configured using a **bet level**, not a fixed bet amount.  
Bet levels range from `0` to a maximum of `6`.

> To view the exact bet amount for a given bet level, you can credit free spins to yourself and check the value directly inside the game.

### Bet Level Notes

- Bet levels and their corresponding bet amounts **may change over time**
- After the **first free spin is played**, the exact bet amount will be locked and stored for that free spins session
- If the player already has an **active free spins session** for the same slot:
  - New free spins will be **added to the existing session**
  - The session’s **validity date will be extended**

⚠️ **Important**

- `bet_level` **cannot be changed** for an already active free spins session
- If you plan to issue free spins with different bet levels, it is strongly recommended to:
  - Split them across different slot machines
  - Avoid overlapping free spins sessions on the same game
